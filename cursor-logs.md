## Overview
This document tracks all development actions and changes made to the Buildcast.ai application throughout the project lifecycle.

## Recent Changes

### JSON Parsing and TTS Fixes (Current Session)
**Issue**: Content generation failing with "Invalid response format from Claude API" despite valid JSON being logged, and "FileReader is not defined" error in TTS generation.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **JSON Parsing**: Unicode characters and edge case validation failures causing parse errors even with valid JSON
2. **TTS Caching**: Next.js cache was potentially serving old FileReader-based code despite Buffer implementation

**Solutions Implemented**:

**For `lib/ai.ts`** (JSON Parsing Fix):
- Added comprehensive Unicode character cleaning (`cleanJsonString()` function)
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging at each step
- Improved validation with more robust type checking (`validateResponse()` function)
- Added progressive JSON cleaning strategy with multiple fallback attempts
- Better error messages with truncated output to avoid log flooding

**For Build System** (TTS Fix):
- Cleared Next.js cache with `rm -rf .next && npm run build`
- Ensured fresh build to eliminate any cached FileReader references
- Verified current `lib/tts.ts` implementation uses Buffer (Node.js) correctly

**Technical Details**:
- JSON cleaning now handles smart quotes, em/en dashes, non-breaking spaces
- Validation checks each field type and structure before proceeding
- Progressive error handling: basic parse → aggressive cleaning → detailed error reporting
- TTS implementation confirmed to use cross-platform blob-to-base64 conversion

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Content generation should work reliably with proper JSON parsing
- Audio generation should work without FileReader errors
- Better error logging for debugging future issues

### Landing Page Reversion (Previous)
**User Request**: Revert from mobile app design back to original landing page feel
**Changes Made**:
- Reverted `app/page.tsx` to traditional landing page with hero section and feature grid
- Reverted `app/learn/page.tsx` to numbered section layout instead of mobile tabs
- Restored original upload area styling in `app/globals.css`
- Enhanced AI parsing in `lib/ai.ts` with better JSON handling and validation
- **Kept two-step architecture** which solved PDF timeout issues

**Result**: ✅ Professional landing page design restored, ✅ Reliable processing maintained

### Enhanced AI Processing & Mobile UX (Earlier)
**Major Features Implemented**:
- Enhanced Claude prompts for detailed concept extraction (6-10 concepts, 500-800 word scripts)
- Long-form audio support with automatic chunking for ElevenLabs limits
- Mobile-first UX with tabbed navigation and swipeable flashcards
- Two-step processing architecture to prevent PDF timeouts
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### Two-Step Architecture Implementation  
**Problem**: PDF processing timeouts causing 500 errors at 50% completion
**Solution**:
- Split into `/api/generate` (fast content, 30s timeout) + `/api/generate-audio` (separate audio, 60s timeout)  
- Immediate display of concepts/flashcards, audio as optional enhancement
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types and user-friendly messages
- Better UX with 5-15 second initial response time

**Result**: ✅ Reliable processing for all file types, ✅ No more timeout issues

### Enhanced AI Prompts (Reverted)
**Initially Enhanced**: 6-10 detailed concepts, 500-800 word lecture scripts, 8-12 comprehensive flashcards
**Issue**: Enhanced prompts caused JSON parsing failures and reliability issues
**Resolution**: Reverted to original simple prompts (5-8 concepts, 2-3 sentence summary, 3-5 flashcards, 1500 max tokens)

**Final Result**: ✅ Reliable AI processing with original working prompts + two-step architecture

## Current State
- ✅ **Landing Page**: Original professional design with hero section and features
- ✅ **Processing**: Two-step architecture prevents timeouts, reliable for all file types  
- ✅ **AI Generation**: Simple, reliable prompts that consistently work
- ✅ **Audio System**: Full playback, download, and cross-context compatibility
- ✅ **UX**: Clean learning interface with numbered sections
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback

## Technical Architecture

- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **AI Processing**: Claude 3 Haiku for content extraction
- **Audio Generation**: ElevenLabs TTS with chunking support
- **File Processing**: PDF-parse for PDFs, Tesseract.js for OCR
